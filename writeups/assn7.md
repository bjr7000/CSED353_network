This assignment took me about 1/6 hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

If you used any part of best-submission codes, specify all the best-submission numbers that you used (e.g., 1, 2): []

- **Caution**: If you have no idea about above best-submission item, please refer the Assignment PDF for detailed description.

Solo portion:
	I use virtual machine, so I copied my code and used other terminal. My
implementation successuflly started, sent, ended a conversation. Also, the
exchanged files' hashes are identical, which means they are identical in very
high possibility.
	Luckily, I did not need to change my code.

Group portion:
	My team name is Baran and teammate's name is Moon Donggyun. My
implementations successfully works as both client and server. I successfully
transfer a one-megabyte file between me and my teammate's implementations, and
the sent file's hash was identical. I not only sent file but received file too,
and I wrote what the file's content in the creative portion part.
	Luckily, I did not need to change my code.

Creative portion (optional):
	We exchanged Prof. Hwang's picture with ASCII art text file. I got his
face with 80 letters wide ASCII art text file.

Other remarks:
	Surprisingly, it takes very small amout of time to sending and receiving
file, and propagation delay takes big part. My 'some' TCP implementation works
well and its speed is fast enough. These works are very invaluable experience
for me.
